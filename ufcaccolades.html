                                    Conor McGregor, who lived up to the hype and beat Eddie Alvarez for the 
                                    lightweight belt to become the first man in UFC history to 
                                    simultaneously hold two belts. The double champ racked in 1,300,00 PPV
                                    buys - $83 million while filling Madison Square Garden. The title-fight ended 
                                    with a four-punch knockout, crowning a new champion.

                                <p>In an extraordinary fashion, Conor McGregor dispatched his opponent Jose Aldo 
                                    in just 13 seconds and one punch. Not only did McGregor win his first UFC belt, he also set
                                    a new UFC record of the fastest knockout in history. This victory ended Jose Aldo's
                                    18-fight winning streak and thus dethroned the future Brazilian Hall of Famer.

                                <p>Originally set for a featherweight title fight with Jose Aldo, the fight was postponed due to an
                                    injury to the champion, Aldo. Conor McGregor was then set to fight Chad Mendes for the 
                                    Interim-Featherweight belt in UFC 189. In a bloody bout, McGregor ruthlessly pumbles Mendes with 3
                                    seconds to go into the second round. McGregor added to his already stunning resume by earning his 18th
                                    win with 4 straight TKOs.

                                    earning him the Cage Warriros lightweight belt. On New Year's Eve in 2012 McGregor
                                    faced off with Ivan Buchinger, and became a two title champion simultaneously. 
                                    The 24-year-old from Dublin, Ireland earned himself a UFC contract immediately after 
                                    the title fight by improving his record to 12-2. At this point in time the "Notorious" 
                                    Conor McGregor was born.
